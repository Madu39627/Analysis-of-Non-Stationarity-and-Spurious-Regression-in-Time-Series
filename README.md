Conducted time series feature engineering, including the creation of lagged variables and rolling statistics (mean and standard deviation).

Applied time series decomposition to isolate Trend, Seasonal, and Residual components of the data.

Employed key diagnostic tests for stationarity, including the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test and the KPSS Test.

Visualized auto-correlation using the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots, and Lag Plots (Lag 1 and Lag 12) to identify temporal dependencies and seasonality.
